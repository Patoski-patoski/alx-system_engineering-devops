# To redirect TCP ports using UFW, you need to follow a series of steps that
# involve enabling packet forwarding and configuring port forwarding rules. 


# enable packet forwarding on your system
sudo touch /etc/ufw/sysctl.conf
echo "net/ip4/ip-forward=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/ufw/sysctl.conf
# this command enables IP forwarding for IPv4 traffic.


# add a NAT rule to redirect traffic from one TCP port to another
sudo sed -i '$a\\n' /etc/ufw/before.rules
echo "*nat
:PREROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
-A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80
COMMIT" | sudo -a tee /etc/ufw/before.rules

# allow traffic through the internal port you redirected to
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp

# apply the changes by restarting UFW
sudo service ufw restart
